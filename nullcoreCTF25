2. Meta Mama
Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

Description:

Ethey‚Ä¶ Insta la bot ah? üëÄ There‚Äôs something strange about the Instagram account: @neuxdemorphous At first glance, it looks like a normal page ‚Äî but beneath the surface, there‚Äôs something hidden.

Solution:

While exploring the challenge, I came across an unusual hint referring to the Instagram account @neuxdemorphous. At first glance, it appeared like a regular profile, but the bio ‚Äúlove is god‚Äù felt oddly cryptic ‚Äî possibly a clue.

Out of curiosity, I sent a direct message to the account. To my surprise, it replied instantly, hinting at some kind of automated bot behind the scenes.

The response included the phrase ‚Äúterrifying NOCTORIAN DRAGON‚Äù, which seemed intentionally emphasized ‚Äî possibly the next clue or part of the flag.

Flag: NOCT{NOCTORIAN_DRAGON}



3. The Mighty Paul
Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

Description:

Forget payloads. Forget Wireshark. This time, the only thing standing between you and the flag‚Ä¶ is pure testosterone.

Straight from the mystical lands of China, The Mighty Paul has trained for this moment his whole life. While others brute-force passwords, Paul brute-forces people.

He doesn‚Äôt speak much. He doesn‚Äôt need to. His forearm does the talking ‚Äî and occasionally the crushing.

Challenge: Face Paul in a real-life arm wrestling duel. Win, and something very interesting might come your way.

6. Mudinja Kandupudi üëÄ
Difficulty: Medium/ 200 points

Description:

Someone uploaded something they shouldn‚Äôt have. The video looks normal, but trust us it‚Äôs not.

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp2KcJoabQw&ab_channel=TeenSpidey

Solution:

The challenge provided a YouTube video with the description: ‚ÄúBEWARE FOR FAKE FLAGS! All the best for finding it, hope you guys make it till the end. üôè

While watching, I spotted a flag within the first five minutes and tried submitting it but it turned out to be a fake. So, I went back, watched the video again carefully, and finally found the real flag at 18:13

7. The Big 5
Difficulty: Medium/ 400 points

Description:

They don‚Äôt need introductions. They don‚Äôt need names. They‚Äôre simply known as‚Ä¶ The Big 5. Five iconic images. Five personalities. And one encrypted mess.

What You‚Äôve Got:

Images 1 to 4 each carry a piece of encrypted data ‚Äî it might look like nothing, but it‚Äôs everything.

Image 5? That‚Äôs your golden ticket. It holds the password to make sense of the rest

Solution:

using unrar we extract the files to see 5 jpg images i wonder what they are hiding

Press enter or click to view image in full size

using exiftool we see a user comment of secret5.jpg

Press enter or click to view image in full size

We got some password seems like we can use it somewhere??? But where?

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Using exiftool i can see that they are password protected and guess what we already have the password soo yea its as simple as that get the password and run a openssl to decrypt it

Cryptography


1. Ronin‚Äôs Shift
Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

Description:

A lone ronin sent a message using an ancient scroll, shifting the letters to protect his secrets. Can you break the old warrior‚Äôs code?

Ciphertext: Wklv lv d vhfuhw phvvdjh iurp wkh vdpxudl frgh

Hint: Brute-forcing won‚Äôt dishonor you.

Solution:

The challenge hint was basically waving a big flag saying Caesar Cipher, bro. The ‚ÄúBrute-forcing‚Äù clue sealed it time to run through all possible shifts. Since ROT3 is a classic, I gave it a shot first.

Shifted each letter back by 3, and boom the scrambled text unfolded into a clean, readable message. Another simple cipher bites the dust.

Flag: NOCT{This_is_a_secret_message_from_the_samurai_code}



2. Hash Me If You Can
Difficulty: Easy/ 200 points

Description:

Here is your Hash: 14d3f05bcced45b09675b22d9047df0fef5c9e889b23ee033f8aad6b93b981cf Can you crack it and find the flag in format?

Solution:

Got a SHA-256 hash and was told to find the flag. Instead of spinning up heavy cracking tools, I tried a few common guesses manually. One of them hit babe. Hashed it again to confirm, and it matched perfectly. Easy win.

Flag: NOCT{babe}



3. RookieRSA
Difficulty: Easy/ 200

Description:

This service encrypts the flag using RSA. But maybe the exponent is a little too small‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre given only N, e, and c.

Can you recover the flag?

Solution:

Found N, e, and c in rookieRSA.txt. With e = 3, I knew it might be weak. Instead of writing code, I plugged the values into an online RSA decryption tool that supports small-exponent attacks. It calculated the cube root, converted it to text, and gave me the flag.

Flag: NOCT{baby_rsa_moment}



4. Ashes of the Cipher
Difficulty: Medium/ 400 points

Description:

In a world where shadows speak and silence writes in rhythm, a message from the ashes awaits a true decoder. Reverse the echo, walk with the elites, and rise with the night. ‚ÄúWhispers echo in reverse. The elites once spoke in rhythm and war. When the code of night (NOCT) aligns, the truth rises from the ashes. Begin with the end, and let wisdom guide each layer.‚Äù

Solution:

Opened Ashes_of_Cipher.txt and saw a long string ending with = classic Base64.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

hmmm seems to the flag needs a reversal
Decoded it and got a series of dots and dashes, which was clearly Morse code. Translating that gave me a string of letters and numbers.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

now add theses ‚Äú{ }‚Äù
The challenge description mentioned ‚Äúreverse echoes,‚Äù so I reversed the string and boom, it matched perfectly.

Flag: NOCT{CRYPTO_SPEEKS_IN_SHADOWS}




5. Return of the Cipher

Difficulty: Medium/ 400 points

Description:

A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again. Download the message here and see if you can break the cipher once more. Patterns repeat, habits form, and those who crack one might just crack another. Can you see what hasn‚Äôt changed?

Solution:

Cracked open the given file and spotted the encrypted flag tucked away at the bottom. The challenge title and description hinted it was using the same Caesar/ROT cipher trick from a previous task.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

got a nice string inside the palceholders
I ran it through a Caesar brute-force and found that a shift of 15 revealed readable text. Swapping out the starting placeholder with NOCT gave the final flag.

Forensics
1. Hidden Scroll
Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

Description:

The Dragon has hidden a scroll in our sponsors logo do you think you have what it takes to find the scroll and help our sponsor out? This CTF is powered by TG cyberlabs a security firm founded by Sriram Kesavan.

Solution:

Bruh, this one was light work. Just hit it with:

stegseek tgcyberlabs.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Boom it coughed up a flag.txt

Description:

we found a dummy pcap file laying around why not help this old dragon out and find me the flag i kept inside this pcap if you do that the dragon will be pleased wink wink‚Ä¶.

Solution:

I opened the pcap in Wireshark and saw there was only one packet. I checked it out and noticed some plain text just sitting there. No tricks or hacks just the flag hanging out in the payload.

3. Hidden Samurai Traffic
Difficulty: Easy/ 200 points

Description:

A silent warrior once passed through the digital realm, leaving no trace‚Ä¶ or so he thought. A base64-encoded scroll lies hidden in the network mist. Can you decode his secret?

Solution:

Found a zip file, unzipped it, and got two files a README and a traffic_flag. README dropped the hint: the secret was base64 encoded. So I opened the traffic_flag file, saw some weird unreadable text ending with ‚Äú==‚Äù classic base64 style.

4. HOT RODS
Difficulty: Easy/ 200 points

Description:

During a casual moment, the top G‚Äôs of the class posed for a group photo but this wasn‚Äôt just a memory capture. The image was part of a planned drop, concealing something far more intentional. Inside the photo lies a hidden message, carefully embedded using metadata. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî the metadata has been hashed or encrypted, requiring deeper forensic work to uncover what‚Äôs beneath. Your Objective: Extract metadata from the image. Decrypt or decode it to reveal a poem. Determine the author of the poem. The author‚Äôs name is your flag.

Solution:

I popped open the pic hunting for a flag unlucky, nothing popped out in plain sight. But the description was already dropping hints about metadata, so I went straight for exiftool

That‚Äôs when I found it a string tucked away in the metadata, looking all encrypted. Gave off strong Base64 vibes, so I ran it through an online decoder. Boom out came a few lines that read like part of a poem or somethin‚Äô.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Quick Google search on those exact lines? Bang it led me to the original work and the author. That author‚Äôs name? That‚Äôs the flag.

5. Swords of the Stream
Difficulty: Medium/ 400 points

Description:

A wandering samurai sent this flag to the wind, hidden in the streams of communication. Can you collect all its whispers? Hint: Base64 is your katana. Split and slash the traffic with precision. Tools like tcpdump, tshark, or any pcap viewer may help.

Solution:

Found a zip file, unzipped it, and got two files a README and a traffic_flag. README dropped the hint: the secret was base64 encoded. So I opened the traffic_flag file, saw some weird unreadable text ending with ‚Äú==‚Äù classic base64 style.

6. Puli Distorted Decode <3
Difficulty: Medium/ 400 points

Description:

You thought ‚ÄúPuli Puli Puli‚Äù was just a song? Think again, puli boy. Rumor has it Darkey was high on crypto and encoded the flag somewhere deep inside this sonic jungle. One guy played it backwards and his speakers caught fire. Another tried humming along and got banned from the CTF. If you survive without questioning your life choices, maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî you‚Äôll find the flag.

No hints. No mercy. Just puli puli puli.

Good luck, puli hunter. You‚Äôll need it.

Solution:

Got a .wav file for the challenge, and my first thought yep, sounds like stego. Popped it open in Audacity (File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Audio), ditched the default waveform, and flipped it to Spectrogram view. That‚Äôs where the magic happens zoomed in on the highs and spotted some funky pulse patterns spelling out text.

Solution:
The challenge name ‚ÄúTrifecta‚Äù was basically screaming three stages, bro. So I popped open the page source and, yep, there were three sneaky Base64 strings chilling in different corners of the files.

Layer 1 ‚Äî Hiding in the CSS like it owned the place, tucked inside a content: property.


Layer 2 ‚Äî Sitting in the HTML under the XSS section, trying to act like a command line snippet. Nice try.

Press enter or click to view image in full size
Layer 3 ‚Äî Just vibing in the linked JavaScript file.


Decoded each of them one by one, slapped the pieces together like digital LEGO, and boom the full flag popped out.

Solution:

First stop ‚Äî robots.txt. Always worth a peek to see what the site doesn‚Äôt want you snooping around in. Sure enough, it had a /unlisted/ path sitting there like a neon ‚Äúcome check me out‚Äù sign.


Rolled over to that directory, and there it was flag.txt just chilling. Opened it up, and boom‚Ä¶ flag secured.

1. Island nga
Difficulty: Easy/ 100 points

Description:

Welcome to Island a place so mysterious, even the fish seem to keep secrets. The water here doesn‚Äôt taste salty ‚Äî it tastes like sweet juice. Locals whisper tales of travelers who came for a sip and stayed forever‚Ä¶ mostly because they couldn‚Äôt find their way back.

Solution:

The challenge description paints a quirky picture ‚ÄúWelcome to Island‚Ä¶ water tastes like sweet juice‚Äù. While most might think of exotic beaches, my mind immediately jumped to a trending Instagram reel from Koomapatty, where a man shouts: ‚ÄúYenaga‚Ä¶ Koomapatty vanga‚Ä¶ thani sharbat mathiri iruku nga‚Ä¶‚Äù That ‚Äúsweet juice‚Äù clue sealed the connection. Since the challenge said the solution is a pincode, I looked up the pincode for Koomapatty and that turned out to be the CTF flag.
